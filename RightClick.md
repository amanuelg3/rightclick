# Introduction #

Remote control program for your PC.


# Details #

Currently, RightClick supports remote keyboard and mouse events. Start the server on one computer (the one to be controlled remotely) and the client on the computer where you'll be sitting with the keyboard and mouse. Move the mouse to the left side of the client screen, and it will appear on the right side of the server. Move it off the right side of the server, and it moves back to the client.

It's that simple. :)
