The need is simple: some people can't use the mouse buttons for whatever reason. By substituting a keyboard key, you can trigger the mouse buttons without wearing out your mouse finger.

So far, this only supports a quick "click" of the mouse. Double-clicks should be doable by pressing the hotkey twice in succession. I have not implemented click-drags quite yet; I'm still working that part out.

This uses the .Net 2.0 Framework. Please have this installed before trying to run RightClick.

## NEWS ##
RightClick is also now a PC remote control program!! It's not a replacement for VNC, but rather just sends keyboard and mouse commands to a remote PC. Use it as a way to control 2 computers that are sitting next to each other.

more details to follow

Join the RightClick project. E-mail me (click the link in the 'project owners' box over on the right) and I'll set you up with write access to the repository.

## Note to downloaders ##
This is not a "commercial" program; it was designed to fill a temporary need, and it's not in active development. RightClick may also require some technical knowledge to set up and use. If this product works for you, then I'm pleased. If it does not, _I am not able to offer technical support_ due to restrictions at my current job.

If you are a computer programmer and you would like to contribute, please e-mail me, and I can set you up with access. I'd love to see other people involved, and I'd much rather have the product improved and hosted here than to have forks all over the Internet.

Thank you for viewing!
